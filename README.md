# simongame

The simon game is a part of The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp (Dr. Angela Yu) from Udemy.
The thing that I added and changed from the original challenge are

1. Start and Restart bottons (Changed from pressing any keys).
2. A capability to control by the keyboard.
3. Changing bottons design and layout.
4. A [How To Play] and a [Credit] button.
5. A tooltip explaining [How To Play] and [Credit].
6. Setting the buttons to be disable to click until the game start.
